The initial/primary purpose will be for consumption by mobile apps (iPhone, Android, Symbian, etc).  I've been looking into different mechanisms for authentication and authorization for web-based APIs (by studying other implementations).  I've got my head wrapped around most of the fundamental concepts but am still looking for guidance in a few areas.  The last thing I want to do is reinvent the wheel, but I'm not finding any standard solutions that fits my criteria (however my criteria my be misguided so feel free to critique that as well).  Additionally, I want the API to be the same for all platforms/applications consuming it.</p>\n\n<h2>oAuth</h2>\n\n<p>I'll go ahead and throw out my objection to oAuth since I know that will likely be the first solution offered.  For mobile applications (or more specifically non-web applications), it just seems wrong to leave the application (to go to a web-browser) for the authentication.  Additionally, there is no way (I am aware of) for the browser to return the callback to the application (especially cross-platform).  I know a couple of apps that do that, but it just feels wrong and gives a break in the application UX.</p>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User enters username/password into application.</li>\n<li>Every API call is identified by the calling application.</li>\n<li>Overhead is kept to a minimum and the auth aspect is intuitive for developers.</li>\n<li>The mechanism is secure for both the end user (their login credentials are not exposed) as well as the developer (their application credentials are not exposed).</li>\n<li>If possible, not require https (by no means a hard requirement).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>My Current Thoughts on Implementation</h3>\n\n<p>An external developer will request an API account.  They will receive an apikey and apisecret.  Every request will require at minimum three parameters.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>apikey - given to developer at regisration </li>\n<li>timestamp - doubles as a unique identifier for each message for a given apikey</li>\n<li>hash - a hash of the timestamp + the apisecret</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The apikey is required to identify the application issuing the request.  The timestamp acts similarly to the oauth_nonce and avoids/mitigates replay attacks.  The hash ensures that request was actually issued from the owner of the given apikey.</p>\n\n<p>For authenticated requests (ones done on the behalf of a user), I'm still undecided between going with an access_token route or a username and password hash combo.  Either way, at some point a username/password combo will be required.  So when it does, a hash of several pieces of information (apikey, apisecret, timestamp) + the password would be used.  <b>I'd love feedback on this aspect.</b>  FYI, they would have to hash the password first, since I don't store the passwords in my system without hashing.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>FYI, this isn't a request for how to build/structure the API in general only how to handle the authentication and authorization from solely within an application.</p>\n\n<h3>Random Thoughts/Bonus Questions</h3>\n\n<p>For APIs that only require an apikey as part of the request, how do you prevent someone other than the apikey owner from being able to see the apikey (since sent in the clear) and make excessive requests to push them over usage limits?  Maybe I'm just over thinking this, but shouldn't there be something to authenticate that a request was verified to the apikey owner?  In my case, that was the purpose of the apisecret, it is never shown/transmitted without being hashed.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of hashes, what about md5 vs hmac-sha1?  Does it really matter when all of the values are hashed with with sufficiently long data (ie. apisecret)?</p>\n\n<p>I had been previously considering adding a per user/row salt to my users password hash.  If I were to do that, how could the application be able to create a matching hash without knowing the salt used?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","design-patterns","api","oop"],"owner":{"reputation":12118,"user_id":25688,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf312679a804d2defbce9f993c9d6a23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken Liu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/25688/ken-liu"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":43185,"accepted_answer_id":1345036,"answer_count":24,"score":173,"last_activity_date":1503020453,"creation_date":1251433318,"last_edit_date":1251434018,"question_id":1345001,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345001/is-it-bad-practice-to-make-a-setter-return-this","title":"Is it bad practice to make a setter return &quot;this&quot;?","body":"<p>Is it a good or bad idea to make setters in java return \"this\"?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Employee setName(String name){\n   this.name = name;\n   return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This pattern can be useful because then you can chain setters like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list.add(new Employee().setName(\"Jack Sparrow\").setId(1).setFoo(\"bacon!\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Employee e = new Employee();\ne.setName(\"Jack Sparrow\");\n...and so on...\nlist.add(e);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but it sort of goes against standard convention. I suppose it might be worthwhile just because it can make that setter do something else useful.

First, let's define some terms:</p>\n\n<p><strong>API change</strong> - a change in the publicly visible definition of a type, including any of its public members. This includes changing type and member names, changing base type of a type, adding/removing interfaces from list of implemented interfaces of a type, adding/removing members (including overloads), changing member visibility, renaming method and type parameters, adding default values for method parameters, adding/removing attributes on types and members, and adding/removing generic type parameters on types and members (did I miss anything?). This does not include any changes in member bodies, or any changes to private members (i.e. we do not take into account Reflection).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Binary-level break</strong> - an API change that results in client assemblies compiled against older version of the API potentially not loading with the new version. Example: changing method signature, even if it allows to be called in the same way as before (ie: void to return type / parameter default values overloads).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source-level break</strong> - an API change that results in existing code written to compile against older version of the API potentially not compiling with the new version. Already compiled client assemblies work as before, however. Example: adding a new overload that can result in ambiguity in method calls that were unambiguous previous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source-level quiet semantics change</strong> - an API change that results in existing code written to compile against older version of the API quietly change its semantics, e.g. by calling a different method. The code should however continue to compile with no warnings/errors, and previously compiled assemblies should work as before. Example: implementing a new interface on an existing class that results in a different overload being chosen during overload resolution.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate goal is to catalogize as many breaking and quiet semantics API changes as possible, and describe exact effect of breakage, and which languages are and are not affected by it. To expand on the latter: while some changes affect all languages universally (e.g. adding a new member to an interface will break implementations of that interface in any language), some require very specific language semantics to enter into play to get a break. This most typically involves method overloading, and, in general, anything having to do with implicit type conversions. There doesn't seem to be any way to define the \"least common denominator\" here even for CLS-conformant languages (i.e. those conforming at least to rules of \"CLS consumer\" as defined in CLI spec) - though I'll appreciate if someone corrects me as being wrong here - so this will have to go language by language. Those of most interest are naturally the ones that come with .NET out of the box: C#, VB and F#; but others, such as IronPython, IronRuby, Delphi Prism etc are also relevant. The more of a corner case it is, the more interesting it will be - things like removing members are pretty self-evident, but subtle interactions between e.g. method overloading, optional/default parameters, lambda type inference, and conversion operators can be very surprising at times.</p>\n\n<p>A few examples to kickstart this:</p>\n\n<h2>Adding new method overloads</h2>\n\n<p>Kind: source-level break</p>\n\n<p>Languages affected: C#, VB, F#</p>\n\n<p>API before change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n    public void Bar(IEnumerable x);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>API after change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n    public void Bar(IEnumerable x);\n    public void Bar(ICloneable x);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample client code working before change and broken after it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new Foo().Bar(new int[0]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Adding new implicit conversion operator overloads</h2>\n\n<p>Kind: source-level break.</p>\n\n<p>Languages affected: C#, VB</p>\n\n<p>Languages not affected: F#</p>\n\n<p>API before change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n    public static implicit operator int ();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>API after change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n    public static implicit operator int ();\n    public static implicit operator float ();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample client code working before change and broken after it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Bar(int x);\nvoid Bar(float x);\nBar(new Foo());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notes: F# is not broken, because it does not have any language level support for overloaded operators, neither explicit nor implicit - both have to be called directly as <code>op_Explicit</code> and <code>op_Implicit</code> methods.</p>\n\n<h2>Adding new instance methods</h2>\n\n<p>Kind: source-level quiet semantics change.</p>\n\n<p>Languages affected: C#, VB</p>\n\n<p>Languages not affected: F#</p>\n\n<p>API before change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>API after change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n    public void Bar();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample client code that suffers a quiet semantics change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class FooExtensions\n{\n    public void Bar(this Foo foo);\n}\n\nnew Foo().Bar();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notes: F# is not broken, because it does not have language level support for <code>ExtensionMethodAttribute</code>, and requires CLS extension methods to be called as static methods. </p>\n"},{"tags":["android","api","level"],"owner":{"reputation":7259,"user_id":310678,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4ebdcdcf8895419cf15a4bbb25f88be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Prospero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/310678/prospero"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":142081,"closed_date":1359084281,"accepted_answer_id":3993933,"answer_count":4,"score":164,"last_activity_date":1504187994,"creation_date":1287722304,"last_edit_date":1495541441,"question_id":3993924,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3993924/get-android-api-level-of-phone-currently-running-my-application","closed_reason":"exact duplicate","title":"Get Android API level of phone currently running my application","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2768806/programmatically-obtain-the-android-api-level-of-a-device\">Programmatically obtain the Android API level of a device?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I get the Api level of the phone curently running my application?

Flat resources that don't contain other resources are no problem. Where I'm running into trouble are the complex Resources.</p>\n\n<p>For instance I have a resource for ComicBook. ComicBook has all sorts of properties on it like author, issue number, date, etc. </p>\n\n<p>A comic book also has a list of 1..n covers. These covers are complex objects. They contain a lot of information about the cover, artist, date, and even a base 64 encoded image of the cover. </p>\n\n<p>For a GET on ComicBook I could just return the comic, and all of the covers including their base64'ed images. That's probably not a big deal for getting a single comic. But suppose I am building a client app that wants to list all of the comics in the system in a table. The table will contain a few properties from the ComicBook resource, but we're certainly not going to want to display all the covers in the table. Returning 1000 comic books, each with multiple covers would result in a ridiculously large amount of data coming across the wire, data that isn't necessary to the end user in that case. </p>\n\n<p>My instinct is to make Cover a resource and ComicBook contains covers. So now Cover is a URI. GET on comic book works now, instead of the huge Cover resource we send back a URI for each cover and clients can retrieve the Cover resources as they require them.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have a problem with creating new comics. Surely I'm going to want to create at least one cover when I create a Comic, in fact that's probably a business rule. So now I'm stuck, I either force the clients to enforce business rules by first submitting a Cover, getting the URI for that cover, then POSTing a ComicBook with that URI in the list, or my POST on ComicBook takes in a different looking Resource than it spits out. The incoming resources for POST and GET are deep copies, where the outgoing GETs contain references to dependent resources. </p>\n\n<p>The Cover resource is probably necessary in any case because I'm sure as a client I'd want to address Covers direction in some cases. So the problem exists in a general form regardless of the size of the dependent resource. In general how do you handle complex Resources without forcing the client to just \"know\" how those resources are composed?</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","rest"],"owner":{"reputation":7048,"user_id":484290,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74f421193f9d9c060354b688f90fa2cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Noor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/484290/noor"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":150801,"accepted_answer_id":13458888,"answer_count":4,"score":138,"last_activity_date":1493209708,"creation_date":1320341407,"last_edit_date":1454508821,"question_id":7999295,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7999295/rest-api-authentication","title":"REST API Authentication","body":"<p>I'm building an application which will be hosted on a server.

The front end of our API is all JavaScript, making direct Ajax calls to the API. </p>\n\n<p>So the question is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>How do you secure an api so that rate-limiting can be removed where in the process in removing such rate-limiting can't be easily spoofed?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Explored Solutions (and why they didn't work)</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Verify the referrer against the host header. -- <em>Flawed because the <strong>referrer</strong> is easily faked.</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Use an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code\" rel=\"nofollow\">HMAC</a> to create a signature based off the request and a shared secret, then verify the request on the server. -- <em>Flawed because the secret and algorithm would be easily determined by looking into the front end JavaScript.</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Proxy the request and sign the request in the proxy -- <em>Still flawed, as the proxy itself exposes the API.</em></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am looking to the brilliant minds on Stack&nbsp;Overflow to present alternate solutions. How would you solve this problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","android","api","firebase","firebase-cloud-messaging"],"owner":{"reputation":817,"user_id":5582307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8SeY1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Corral","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5582307/david-corral"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":146796,"protected_date":1490886004,"accepted_answer_id":37376757,"answer_count":8,"score":110,"last_activity_date":1503830841,"creation_date":1463904710,"last_edit_date":1483001012,"question_id":37371990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37371990/how-can-i-send-a-firebase-cloud-messaging-notification-without-use-the-firebase","title":"How can I send a Firebase Cloud Messaging notification without use the Firebase Console?","body":"<p>I'm starting with the new Google service for the notifications, <code>Firebase Cloud Messaging</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to this code <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/tree/master/messaging\">https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/tree/master/messaging</a> I was able to send notifications from my <strong>Firebase User Console</strong> to my Android device.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any API or way to send a notification without use the Firebase console?

ugly!)</p>\n\n<p>I have the following options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>build the Rest API Server from scratch</li>\n<li>use a tiny Scala web framework like <a href=\"http://github.com/scalatra/scalatra\"

I've seen some resources say HTTP-Auth is the way to go, while others prefer API keys, and even others (including the questions I found here on SO) swear by OAuth. </p>\n\n<p>Then, of course, the ones that prefer, say, API keys, say that OAuth is designed for applications getting access on behalf of a user (as I understand it, such as signing into a non-Facebook site using your Facebook account), and not for a user directly accessing resources on a site they've specifically signed up for (such as the official Twitter client accessing the Twitter servers).

The server validates the user against the token Facebook issues to the iOS user and issues a temporary Session token. From this point the user needs to download content that is stored in S3. This content only belongs to the user and a subset of his friends. This user can add more content to S3 which can be accessed by the same bunch of people. I guess it is similar to attaching a file to a Facebook group...</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 ways a user can interact with S3... leave it to the server or get the server to issue a temporary S3 token (not sure of the possibilities here) and the user can hit up on the content URLs directly to S3.

Does this mean I have to download all content to server before handing it down to the connected users?</li>\n<li>If you know rails... can I use paperclip and aws-sdk gems to achieve this kinda setup?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Apologies for multiple questions and I appreciate any insight into the problem.

I think I've got the API figured out, but now I'm turning to the clients.  As I've been reading about REST, I see that a key part of REST is <em>discovery</em>, but there seems to be a lot of debate between two different interpretations of what discovery really means:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Developer discovery</strong>: The developer hard-codes copious amounts of API details into the client, such as resource URI's, query parameters, supported HTTP methods, and other details that they've discovered through browsing the docs and experimenting with the API's responses.  This type of discovery IMHO necessitates cool linkage and the API versioning question, and leads to hard coupling of the client code to the API.  Not much better than if using a well-documented collection of RPC's it seems.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Runtime discovery</strong> - The client app itself is able to figure out everything it needs with little or no out-of-band information (presumably, only a knowledge of the media types the API deals with.)  Links can be hot.  But to make the API very efficient, a lot of link templating for query parameters seems to be needed, which makes out-of-band info creep back in.  There are possibly other difficulties I haven't thought of yet since I haven't gotten to that point in development.  But I do like the idea of loose coupling.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Runtime discovery seems to be the holy grail of REST, but I'm seeing precious little discussion about how to implement such a client.  Almost all REST sources I've found seem to assume Developer discovery.  Anyone know of some Runtime discovery resources?  Best practices?  Examples or libraries with real code?  I'm working in PHP (Zend Framework) for one client.  Objective-C (iOS) for the other.</p>\n\n<p>Is Runtime discovery a realistic goal, given the present set of tools and knowledge in the developer community?  I can write my client to treat all of the URI's in an opaque manner, but how to do this most efficiently is a question, especially over low-bandwidth connections.  Anyway, URI's are only part of the equation.  What about link templating in the Runtime context?  How about communicating what methods are supported, aside from making a lot of OPTIONS requests?</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","naming-conventions","api-design"],"owner":{"reputation":20909,"user_id":974,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d7e0433078e5d9b54fb90edf7bd10a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"izb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/974/izb"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":5553,"protected_date":1499032966,"accepted_answer_id":157810,"answer_count":28,"score":73,"last_activity_date":1458297374,"creation_date":1222870484,"last_edit_date":1345073827,"question_id":157807,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/157807/gb-english-or-us-english","title":"GB English, or US English?","body":"<p>If you have an API, and you are a UK-based developer with a highly international audience, should your API be </p>\n\n<pre><code>setColour()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>setColor()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(To take one word as a simple example.)</p>\n\n<p>UK-based engineers are often quite defensive about their 'correct' spellings but it could be argued that US spelling is more 'standard' in the international market.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the question is does it matter?

Sure cool we like to share! Get a public API key and read away!</li>\n<li>User wants to store/update data... woah wait up! who are you, can you do this?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would like to build it once and allow say a web-app, an android application or an iPhone application to use it.</p>\n\n<p>A REST API appears to be a logical choice with requirements like this</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate my question I'll use a simple example.</p>\n\n<p>I have an item in a database, which has a <strong>rating</strong> attribute (integer 1 to 5).</p>\n\n<p>If I understand REST correctly I would implement a GET request using the language of my choice that returns csv, xml or json like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://example.com/product/getrating/{id}/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Say we pick JSON we return:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"name\": \"widget1\",\n  \"attributes\": { \"rating\": {\"type\":\"int\", \"value\":4} }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is fine for public facing APIs. I get that part.</p>\n\n<p>Where I have tons of question is how do I combine this with a security model? I'm used to web-app security where I have a session state identifying my user at all time so I can control what they can do no matter what they decide to send me.  As I understand it this isn't RESTful so would be a bad solution in this case.</p>\n\n<p>I'll try to use another example using the same item/rating.</p>\n\n<p>If user \"JOE\" wants to add a <strong>rating</strong> to an <strong>item</strong></p>\n\n<p>This could be done using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://example.com/product/addrating/{id}/{givenRating}/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point I want to store the data saying that \"JOE\" gave product {id} a rating of {givenRating}.</p>\n\n<p>Question: How do I know the request came from \"JOE\" and not \"BOB\".</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, what if it was for more sensible data like a user's phone number?</p>\n\n<p>What I've got so far is:</p>\n\n<p>1) Use the built-in feature of HTTP to authenticate at every request, either plain HTTP or HTTPS.</p>\n\n<p>This means that every request now take the form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>https://joe:joepassword@example.com/product/addrating/{id}/{givenRating}/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2) Use an approach like Amazon's S3 with private and public key: <a href=\"http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/designing-a-secure-rest-api-without-oauth-authentication/\">http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/designing-a-secure-rest-api-without-oauth-authentication/</a></p>\n\n<p>3) Use a cookie anyway and break the stateless part of REST.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach appears better to me, but I am left wondering do I really have to re-invent this whole thing? Hashing, storing, generating the keys, etc all by myself? </p>\n\n<p>This sounds a lot like using session in a typical web application and rewriting the entire stack yourself, which usually to me mean \"You're doing it wrong\" especially when dealing with security.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned OAuth as well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","continuous-integration","api-key","travis-ci"],"owner":{"reputation":5073,"user_id":94154,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5317865dc121a69c375a6daf722ca9ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user94154","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/94154/user94154"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":13747,"accepted_answer_id":12778315,"answer_count":3,"score":72,"last_activity_date":1491505750,"creation_date":1329537962,"question_id":9338428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9338428/using-secret-api-keys-on-travis-ci","title":"Using secret api keys on travis-ci","body":"<p>I'd like to use <a href=\"http://travis-ci.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">travis-ci</a> for one of my <a href=\"https://github.com/adelevie/parse-ruby-client\" rel=\"noreferrer\">projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project is an API wrapper, so many of the tests rely on the use of secret API keys.
